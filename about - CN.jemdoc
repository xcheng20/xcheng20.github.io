- I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in School of Electronics and Information from [https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/ Northwestern Polytechnical University], Xi'an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively. From Sept. 2014 to Dec. 2018, I was a PhD student in the [https://jcwcenter.web.rug.nl/ Jan C. Willems Center for Systems and Control], [https://www.rug.nl/research/enteg/ Engineering and Technology Institute Groningen], at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, [https://www.rug.nl/ University of Groningen], the Netherlands, where I worked on the topic "[https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/model-reduction-of-network-systems-with-structure-preservation(b431dc0a-f0ec-40ed-a8b0-7b84a8c29d48).html /Model reduction of network systems with structure preservation/]", under the supervision of [https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.m.a.scherpen/ *Prof. Jacquelien M. A. Scherpen*]. I received my Ph.D. degree (distinction cum laude) in Nov. 2018. Since Jan. 2019, I have moved to the [https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/control-systems/ control systems group], Department of Electrical Engineering at the [https://www.tue.nl/ Eindhoven University of Technology], the Netherlands, where I am currently a postdoc working on the project "/Data-Driven Modeling in Dynamic Networks/", under the supervision of [http://www.pvandenhof.nl/ *Prof. Paul M.J. Van den Hof*]. I am the recipient of the [https://www.ifac-control.org/awards/journal-awards *Paper Prize Award*] *from the IFAC Journal Automatica* for the best paper published in the triennium 2017-2019 and the 2020 *IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology Outstanding Paper
Award*.\n

- I have been a [https://www.ieee.org/ IEEE]  member since 2013 and a member of the [http://disc.tudelft.nl/ Dutch Institute of Systems and Control (DISC)] since 2014. 

- Broadly, my research lies in the direction of modeling and control in networked systems, which have a wide range of applications including power grids, networked robots, and biochemical reactions. I am particularly interested in there topics in dynamic networks: reduced-order modelling (model reduction), data-driven modelling (system identification), and distributed/decentralized control.
