<h2>Bio</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in School of Electronics and Information from <a href="https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>, Xi'an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively. From Sept. 2014 to Dec. 2018, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://jcwcenter.web.rug.nl/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Jan C. Willems Center for Systems and Control</a>, <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/enteg/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Engineering and Technology Institute Groningen</a>, at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.rug.nl/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>University of Groningen</a>, the Netherlands, where I worked on the topic &ldquo;<a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/model-reduction-of-network-systems-with-structure-preservation(b431dc0a-f0ec-40ed-a8b0-7b84a8c29d48).html" target=&rdquo;blank&ldquo;><i>Model reduction of network systems with structure preservation</i></a>&rdquo;, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.m.a.scherpen/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Jacquelien M. A. Scherpen</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree (distinction cum laude) in Nov. 2018. From Jan. 2019 to Dec. 2020, I was a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/control-systems/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>control systems group</a>, Department of Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Eindhoven University of Technology</a>, the Netherlands, where I worked on the project &ldquo;<i>Data-Driven Modeling in Dynamic Networks</i>&rdquo;, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.pvandenhof.nl/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Paul M.J. Van den Hof</a>. 
I am currently a research associate in the Control Group at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, working with <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/icl20" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dr. Ioannis Lestas</a> on the project &ldquo;Analysis and Control of Large Scale Networks&rdquo;.

</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am the recipient of the <a href="https://www.ifac-control.org/awards/journal-awards" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><b>Paper Prize Award</b></a> <b>from the IFAC Journal Automatica</b> for the best paper published in the triennium 2017-2019 and the 2020 <b>IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology Outstanding Paper
Award</b>.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have been an <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>IEEE</a>  member since 2013 and a member of the <a href="http://disc.tudelft.nl/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dutch Institute of Systems and Control (DISC)</a> since 2014. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Broadly, my research lies in the direction of modeling and control in networked systems, which have a wide range of applications including power grids, networked robots, and biochemical reactions. I am particularly interested in there topics in dynamic networks: reduced-order modeling (model reduction), data-driven modeling (system identification), and distributed/decentralized control.
