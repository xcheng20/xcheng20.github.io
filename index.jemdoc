== About Me
I am an assistant professor in the Mathematical and Statistical Methods Group([https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/plant-research/biometris.htm Biometris]) at [https://www.wur.nl/ Wageningen University & Research (WUR)].   \n \n

Before joining WUR, I was a research associate in the Department of Engineering at the [https://www.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge] and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [https://www.tue.nl/ Eindhoven University of Technology]. I received my B.S. and M.E. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and completed my Ph.D. degree with honors (cum laude) from the [https://www.rug.nl/  University of Groningen] in November 2018 under the supervision of [https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.m.a.scherpen/cv?lang=en Prof. Jacquelien M. A. Scherpen]. I am the recipient of the Paper Prize Award from the IFAC Journal /Automatica/ in the triennium 2017-2019 and the Outstanding Paper Award from /IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology/ in 2020.\n \n

My research interests lie at the intersection of control systems and machine learning, with a focus on data-driven modeling, dimensionality reduction, and optimization for control. Furthermore, I am also interested in developing solutions for real-world  systems such as energy systems and agricultural systems.
